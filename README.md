<h2>PIG GAME!!! ðŸŽ²</h2>
<hr />

<p>
  That's a cool dice rolling game. You can play with a friend or even alone
  (against yourself ðŸ˜…). The dice rolls randomly and gives a number, as usual,
  between 1 and 6, but, if the player gets 1 he loses all of the points of the
  round and the game switches to the other player. The player who first achieves
  the 100 points wins!

  I had a great time building (along with the teacher, of course) this project.
  It was a hard one, but I pushed my abilities and at the end it worthed it.

<p>
  With the pig game I've practiced some more of class and DOM manipulation and
  events.
